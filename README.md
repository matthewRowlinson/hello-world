Github Hello World!
I am a Computer Science student focusing on software development. I especially like Ruby, Python, Java, and Javascript. I have also used C. I would like to graduate with a degree sometime in 2020! After that I would like to work somewhere in the Greater New York area, or maybe somewhere else. I love to write code.
